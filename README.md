## Hi, Athanasia here 👋 
___

I'm from 🌞Greece🇬🇷 but since 2014 I live in ⛷️Switzerland🇨🇭! Both countries are always in my ❤️.
My career started as a Librarian but somewhere along the way I discovered my passion for data manipulation. This led me to a master's degree in Information and Data Management and the realization that I love statistics, sql and databases!

My coding journey began in 2018 with ![Markdown logo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-FFD43B?style=for-the-badge&logo=python&logoColor=darkgreen). I am now a big fan of the language and use it especially for data analysis, data visualization and machine learning. 
I love learning new things! In the repos you can find a small sample of what I do. More is coming soon...🐣
